Create a program which displays a beautiful square.

my_square(5,3) should display:

```$>./a.out 5 3
o---o
|   |
o---o
$>
```
my_square(5, 1) should display:

```$>./a.out 5 1
o---o

my_square(1, 1) should display:

```$>./a.out 1 1

# My Cat

| My_Square        |                             |

| Submit Directory | ex00                        |
| Submit file      | my_cat.c                    |


Create a program called my_cat which does the same thing as the system's cat command used in the command-line.

Your program should read the content of each files which are received as an argument to your software.

Unlike the real Cat command, you don't have to handle any options. :-)
